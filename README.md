# BasketApplication
A simple basket application using Spring Boot

In the **com.example.basketapplication.controllers** directory, is the controller file that is used to map the necessary endpoints. 

In the **com.example.basketapplication.models** directory, are the model files, which include the logic needed for the application to function.
The **Product.java** file is used to model the product object, and it provides to it the necessary features.
The **ProductList.java** file is used to put a few products in the application.
The **Basket.java** file uses the two previous classes, in order to allow the user to add, and to remove products from the basket.

In the **test** directory, there are the tests that have been written using JUnit5, in order to make sure that the logic written in the classes, works as it was intended to work.
